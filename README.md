# FinanceTracker
A tool written in python to help me track my finances

## Tools used

- PyQt5
- Anaconda
- SQLite

## Purpose

When trying to track my finances I realized that the simple app on my phone was missing several features that I wanted to have, and I did not want to invest in a fancy software like QuickenBooks as my needs were not that great.  So I set out to create my own tool that has the features the phone app is missing, but not as many as Quicken-esque software.
